# LAP 3 Futureproof React Quiz Project

## Introduction

This project is part of futureproofs 13-week bootcamp for the 3rd Lap. The task was to design and develop a quiz app using React, an API which utilises websockets such as [SocketIO](https://socket.io/docs/v4/), and usage of the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

Our quiz app is named **AstroQuiz**, a space-themed app which lets users create a room for questions, which other users can join. Once joined the users can participate in the quiz, and once completed, the app will display the final scores of the users.

## Pre-requisites

A minimum of [Node v16.11.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) needs to be installed

## Installing

After git cloning this repository, CD into the directory, `quizpicables`, and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

After the dependencies are installed, the app is ready to be launched

## Launching the App

To start the app, run the following script:

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Testing

For testing, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) has been implemented. To run the test, execute the following command:

```
$ npm t
```

## Hosting

**AstroQuiz** is hosted on [Netlify](https://fanciful-cranachan-239991.netlify.app/) and available to play

## Improvements

Given the scope and timeline of the project, we were not able to implement many features we had in mind. If the scope of the project allowed it, we would add the following improvements to **AstroQuiz**:

- Add a limit to the number of users that can play the Quiz at one time
- etc
